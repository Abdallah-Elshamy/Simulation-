In ps2.py we provided you with the Robot class, which stores the position and direction of a robot. For this class, decide what fields you will use and decide how the following operations are to be performed:

    Initializing the object
    Accessing the robot's position
    Accessing the robot's direction
    Setting the robot's position
    Setting the robot's direction

Complete the Robot class by implementing its methods in ps2.py.

Note: When a Robot is initialized, it should clean the first tile it is initialized on. Generally the model these Robots will follow is that after a robot lands on a given tile, we will mark the entire tile as clean. This might not make sense if you're thinking about really large tiles, but as we make the size of the tiles smaller and smaller, this does actually become a pretty good approximation.
